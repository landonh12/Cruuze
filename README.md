# Cruuze

This is an app that stemmed from SpeedLimit, a project I made to help me and my Girlfriend sync our cruise control speeds on the highway/interstate
when going on long drives (like to and from college).

## Features

This app uses a Firebase real-time database to sync location data between two devices. Later on, I plan on expanding this,
allowing multiple users on the service and syncing everyone's location data together to get real-time traffic conditions.
